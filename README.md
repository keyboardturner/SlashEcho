# SlashEcho


Basic usage: `/echo inputHere`

you can link yourself an item for example if you shift-click it in, such as `/echo [Very Cool Item]`.

This was originally intended to link myself items from the dressing room to try on the pieces of an outfit without trying on the entire outfit. It's meant to work pretty similarly to the Unix-like operating system command by the same name.
